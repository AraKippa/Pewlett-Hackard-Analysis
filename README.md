# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7

The phrase "silver tsunami" seems an appropriate fit for the upcoming number of potential retirements at Pewlett Hackard.  Let's take a look at some of the data to try and get a better look idea of the situation.

With 300,024 total employees and 41,380 staff near, or at retirement age;  14% of staff currently fall within retirement eligibility.

This is a fairly large percentage of total staff that will need to be replaced. This will primarily create holes in management positions, as many of the upcoming retirees are in filling those jobs.

There are 1940 mentorship eligible people.  If we're looking at ultimately hiring 41k to replace the retirees, then mentoring the incoming batch will be a full time job.  If you hire half of what you need the first year (hoping some people stay past retirement); that leaves 1940 mentoring about 11 people each.  A better plan would be to increase the age limit for these mentorees or perhaps set them up as "senior mentors." Then more junior level staff can help guide them on a daily basis. After all, these mentorship people are also training their daily replacements, unless the company hires from outside.  
While reviewing the data it became clear several of the staff management had previously been managers in other departments. This could be usefull for the mentorship program.


The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
