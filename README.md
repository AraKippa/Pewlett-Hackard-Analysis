# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7

The phrase "silver tsunami" seems an appropriate fit for the upcoming number of potential retirements at Pewlett Hackard.  However, let's take a look at some of the data to try and get a better idea of the situation.

With 300,024 total employees and 41,380 staff near, or at retirement age;  14% of staff currently fall within retirement eligibility.   This seems a fairly large percentage of total staff that will need to be replaced. This will primarily create holes in management positions, as many of the upcoming retirees are filling those jobs. [Retiring Management] (https://github.com/AraKippa/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv) PH needs to start fully supporting it's Mentorship Plan.

In that plan there are currently 1940 eligible personnel. [Mentorship figures](https://github.com/AraKippa/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv) If we're looking at ultimately hiring 41k to replace the retirees, then mentoring the incoming batch could be a full time job.  If you hire half of what you need the first year (hoping some people stay past retirement); that leaves 1940 mentoring about 11 people each.  A better plan would be to decrease the age limit for these mentorees, or perhaps set them up as "senior mentors." Then, more junior level staff can help guide them on a daily basis. After all, these mentorship people are also training their daily replacements, unless the company hires from outside.  
Additionally, several of the current staff management have previously been managers in other departments. This could be usefull for the mentorship program and it could provide some management flexibility.

These retirement figures are not unmanageable.  Looking at the Bureau of Labor Statistics current figures, the average of separations in the Professional fields is over 1k per month. [BLS data] (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t03.htm#jolts_table3.f.2)  With good management, a robust hiring plan and support for the mentorship program, PH can negotiate this "tsunami."
